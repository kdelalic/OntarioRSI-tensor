# TensorFlow (1.4.0) Image Classifier Gradle Standalone Port

- Clone the project, and checkout the tag `1.4.0`
- Import it on Android Studio
- Run it
- That's all.

This project is a way to get started with TensorFlow Image Classifier quickly.

I am not planning to maintain it. If you need an updated version, build it yourself using hints from this [blog post][blog-post].
